The Ballad of Jerry the Bard and His Wayward Companions
In the land of Elarion, where the mountains did kiss the sky and the forests whispered secrets old as the gods, there strode a peculiar troupe of adventurers whose deeds echo still in song and story. At the heart of this gallant fellowship stood a flame-eyed tiefling bard by name of Jerry of the Brimstone Strings.

Jerry, born beneath an ill-fated comet in the soot-streaked streets of Duskhaven, bore the mark of infernal lineage — curling obsidian horns, crimson skin kissed by fire, and eyes like molten gold. Yet nay, was he cursed by his blood — he turned it to glory, wielding lute and lyric like blade and bow. His voice could charm coins from a miser’s purse and lull dragons to slumber. 'Twas said that even Death would pause to hear him play.

But Jerry was never alone upon the road. Nay! He traveled with a band of true-hearted misfits, each bound by fate and friendship. Let their names be sung!

Sir Garron Thrice-Forged – The Human Paladin of the Broken Sun
Once a knight of the grand city of Valthorne, Garron forsook the oaths of empire after the massacre at Black Hollow. With hair silver as moonlight and armor dented by a hundred righteous wars, he sought redemption not in temples, but in deeds. He bore a greatsword named Mercy, and spoke oft of justice, but never of his own wounds — save to Jerry, whom he trusted as a brother.

Thistle Quickfingers – The Halfling Rogue with a Laugh Like Silver Bells
A nimble shadow from the thieves’ guilds of Merribay, Thistle had a sharp wit and sharper daggers. Her fingers could untie fate itself, and she had a penchant for stealing noble hearts (and noble purses). Beneath her grin, though, lay scars — old memories of betrayal and a brother lost in the catacombs of Vel Umbrum. Jerry oft sang ballads to cheer her, though none more beloved than The Lady Who Danced with the Moon — a secret ode written just for her.

Bronnax of the Emberdeep – The Dragonborn Sorcerer, Fire-Touched
With scales of copper and a temper hot as the forges of his kin, Bronnax was a wyrmling no longer. Cast out by his clan for meddling with ancient, wild magicks, he wandered the world seeking to understand the fire that burned within — and to control it. Jerry found in him a kindred spirit: both outcasts, both aflame. They would speak late into the night, the bard scribbling lyrics while Bronnax conjured sparks to dance like fireflies.

Elira Moonshade – The Elven Druid of the Verdant Veil
Tall and ethereal, her hair like woven moonlight, Elira hailed from the sacred groves of Leth’Silwen. She walked with wolves and spoke to rivers, wielding the wrath of the wild in thorn and storm. Though quiet, her laughter was rare and radiant — a sound Jerry likened to a melody from another world. Many a song did he write of her, though he ne'er told her so directly. He oft claimed, “A bard must hold a mystery or two, lest the music lose its magic.”

Together, these five traveled through ruin and revelation. They felled the Lich of Withered Fen, cracked the riddles of the Labyrinth of Whispers, and sealed the Void Gate before the stars themselves could bleed. They laughed in taverns and wept in battle. They buried friends. They made legends.

Jerry chronicled it all, every sorrow and triumph. His ballads were sung across the realm — but never with full truth. For Jerry knew that some tales are for the campfire, not the court. Some truths belong to those who lived them.

The Saga of the Shattered Star
Long before the peace of Elarion, ‘ere the twin moons were yet aligned, there came a darkness from beyond the stars — a whisper in the void called Xarithar, the Star-Eater. It sought the ancient artifact known as the Stellar Shard, buried beneath the city of Myrethil, a jewel of civilization atop the world's oldest leyline. If the shard were taken, reality itself would unravel like a bard's torn parchment.

The people knew not of this danger, but the stars trembled.

Thus it was, that fate drew Jerry and his companions to the city on the eve of the Moonfall Festival, where dancers twirled and fireworks kissed the skies. Jerry, as ever, stood atop a wine-stained table in a tavern called The Grinning Goat, serenading locals with a bawdy tune about a basilisk and a chicken. He wore his best hat — a plum-colored wide-brim with a feather stolen (liberated, he’d say) from a griffon in flight.

Suddenly, Bronnax burst in, smoke trailing from his nostrils.

“The sky weeps fire,” said the dragonborn, “and something old wakes beneath our feet.”

Chapter One: The Rift Beneath Myrethil
That very night, the earth cracked beneath Myrethil’s streets. From the sewers and vaults, creatures of void-born flesh slithered forth — whispering tongues and eyes like lanterns. Elira, with roots wrapping her limbs, called upon the grove spirits to halt the tide. Garron strode into the fray with Mercy raised, a beacon of radiant judgment. Thistle vanished into shadow, knives seeking vital points the monsters scarcely knew they had.

Jerry, spinning between song and sword, sang verses that bolstered his allies and disoriented the foe. His melody turned fear to courage, chaos to rhythm. His lute, Whispersong, hummed with magic old and primal.

They fought through alley and catacomb, deeper into the dark — to the Astral Vault beneath the old palace.

There lay the Shard.

And beside it, Xarithar, half-formed and crawling from a tear in the weave of the world.

Chapter Two: The Unraveling
The battle was not of might alone, for Xarithar was no mere beast — it was the memory of collapse, a godling of entropy. Its whispers turned doubt into poison. Garron’s blade grew heavy with guilt. Thistle heard the voice of her lost brother. Elira wept, as roots shriveled in her hands.

But Jerry, ah Jerry — he stepped forward.

He sang not with confidence, but with truth. A humble tune at first, a lullaby from the orphanage of Duskhaven. He let his voice crack. He let his soul bare.

Then the song rose, powerful and defiant — a song not of perfection, but of unity.

"We are the flame ‘gainst night’s cold maw,
The laugh that mocks the coming fall.
Where one doth stand, we all shall rise —
The world shall live beneath our cries!"

The magic of the song intertwined with the Shard itself — for the artifact was no mere relic. It fed on story, on meaning. And Jerry, in that moment, became the meaning.

The Shard ignited in starlight. Light poured from Jerry’s chest, through his companions, and into the rift.

Bronnax unleashed a gout of sorcerous flame that carved runes across the sky. Elira summoned the full wrath of the forest — ancient spirits wrapped in vines and thunder. Garron, tears in his eyes, drove Mercy through the essence of the Star-Eater.

And Thistle — sly, nimble Thistle — leapt through the collapsing reality to snatch the true core of Xarithar from the void and crush it between her hands.

The rift screamed, then sang, then was no more.

Chapter Three: The Morning After
When dawn broke, Myrethil’s skies were blue once more. The people emerged, confused but safe. They knew not the details — only that the world had nearly ended, and had not.

Jerry stood on the palace balcony, covered in soot, missing a boot, and smiling like a man who’d seen both heaven and hell.

He tuned Whispersong, strummed a chord, and said:

“Fear not, dear people! For the darkness came a’knockin’,
And found itself quite soundly rockin’ —
By song and steel and sneaky socks,
We sent it back to starless rocks!”

The city erupted in cheers.

Epilogue
To this day, in taverns from the icy fjords of Galdurheim to the sand-swept dunes of Cal Tessor, the Ballad of the Shattered Star is sung.

And always, the tale ends the same:

"And when the sky falls once again, look to the west —
Where a tiefling with a lute and a grin will rise,
With friends at his side and fire in his song."
